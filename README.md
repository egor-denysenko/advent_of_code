# advent_of_code_2023

This repo will contain my solutions to advent of code.

## Local env setup

To run solutions you need to have installed:
    - go 1.21

### Use nix
To simplify requirements for running scripts there is also a nix flake to setup local env.
You need to have nix installed with flake support enabled.
To create a development shell with nix run at the root of the repository: `nix develop`
